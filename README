Active OLAP
===========

This Rails plugin makes it easy to add an OLAP interface to your application, which is 
great for administration interfaces. Its main uses are collection information about the
usage of your application and detecting inconsistencies and problems in your data.

This plugin is developed for the Floorplanner.com website. It is currently being cleanup 
up for public release. It will be BSD-licensed, so you can use it for any purpose you 
see fit.
